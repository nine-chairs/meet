## Description

The goal of this project is to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

### User stories and tesing scenarios
* As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event. 
1.	Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default
Given the main page is open
When a user search for a city and the events are loaded
Then the event element details will be hidden
2.	Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details
Given the list of events has been loaded
When user clicks on “Show details” button for an event
Then the event element will be expanded to show the event details
3.	Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details
Given the “Show details” button for an event has been clicked and the details are expanded
When user clicks on “Hide details” button on that event
Then the event element will collapse again, hiding the details

* As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once. 
1.	Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number
Given a user has chosen the city they want to see events for
When the user doesn’t specify a number of events they want to view
Then the default number will be set to 32
2.	Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see
Given a user has chosen the city they want to see events for
When they type a number into the box “Number of Events”
Then the according number of events will load for the respective city

* As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online. 
1.	Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection
Given a user has used the app before
When they access the website offline
Then the events they viewed previously will be shown
2.	Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)
Given a user accesses the website offline
When they change the setting such as city or time range
Then an error will be shown

* As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city. 
1.	Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
Given a user has chosen a city
When the list of events is shown
Then on top of the list a chart that visualizes the type of upcoming events will be shown



## Key features

* Filter events by city.
* Show/hide event details.
* Specify number of events.
* Use the app when offline.
* Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
* View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.



## Technical Requirements

* React application
* Built using TDD technique
* Use the Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow.
* Use use serverless functions (AWS lambda is preferred) for the authorization server instead of using a traditional server
* Work offline or in slow network conditions with the help of a service worker.
* Use React axios and async/await.
* Implement an alert system using an OOP approach to show information to the user.
* Make use of data visualization using the recharts library.
* Be monitored using an online monitoring tool.
